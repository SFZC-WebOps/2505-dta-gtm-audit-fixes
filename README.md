## 🛠️ Usage Notes

- Avoid spaces in folder names — use hyphens instead
- Each folder may be its own Git repo or sub-project
- Shared tooling or configs should live in `/webops-config` if needed

## 🧠 Repo Philosophy

Keep things flat, clear, and automation-friendly. This structure supports:
- Rapid CLI navigation
- Date-based scanning
- Easy archival or cleanup
