Change Description

Modified Google Tag Manager (GTM-TGH83XK) configuration to only track successful page loads by setting Response Status conditions to only include ""Success (200)"" status codes. This change prevents Google Analytics from tracking 404 error pages, which was inflating error statistics.

Safety Considerations

    Low-risk configuration change that doesn't affect site functionality
    Only modifies analytics data collection, not user-facing content
    No impact on page loading times or server performance

Monitoring Plan

    Daily review of Google Analytics reports for 7 days post-change
    Compare to baseline report (SFZC_404_Baseline_Report_Pre-GTM-Fix_April2025.png)
    Verify 404 error percentage drops from ~82% to ~13-14%

Checking on Cookiebot

to me

Hey Greg,

Happy Monday. In an effort to get our FB ads tracking working correctly, I've been working with a small firm, Community Boost, outsourced to us by Classy to assist (at no extra cost) with making sure our FB Ads Manager (FB Pixel) and Classy Conversions API are setup and tracking correctly. It's taken a few weeks but has gone well.

In the course of this work, last week on Friday, Community Boost saw something they thought I should bring up with you. They mentioned that our GTM is not fully configured to wrap tags based off of the Cookiebot banner...they mentioned something about our gate not being configured. I've attached some screenshots from our meeting that might be useful for reference. 

I'm not totally sure about the technical details beyond this, but wanted to mention it to you. I don't think this is a super-high priority since we've been operating with our current configuration for some time now. Just wanted to put this on your radar.

Thanks,
Dan
