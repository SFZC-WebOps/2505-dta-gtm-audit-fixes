## üìã Verified Tracking IDs and Tags
| Platform            | ID / Name                      | Deployment Context              |
|---------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| GA4                 | G-BRXZCXMZP5                    | Web (GTM-TGH83XK)               |

### ‚úÖ Verified Local Testing Environment (2025-05-24)
- A controlled GTM validation environment was created using OrbStack + Docker on macOS.
- URL: `http://localhost:8080` served via NGINX container mapped to `/Volumes/webops-work/SITES/gtm-test`
- Used container: `GTM-TGH83XK` (Preview Mode only)
- Consent Mode validated via Tag Assistant (Consent tab):
  - `analytics_storage`: Denied by default
  - `ad_storage`: Denied
  - `security_storage`: Granted
- Confirmed that GTM tags honor consent gating
- No changes were published to production or Drupal



------



## üöß Outstanding Questions / To Be Verified

- Is the server-side GTM container actively in use (e.g., routed via DNS, App Engine, or GA4 forwarding)?
- Can administrative access to `GTM-M7BMM8ZQ` be obtained from Temple Advertising?
- Are any tags still relying on the deprecated UA (`UA-1720237-1`)?
- The following core compliance and tracking capabilities are **not yet implemented** and require remediation before further publishing (these gaps expose SFZC to privacy compliance risk (GDPR/CCPA) and limit analytics accuracy. Tasks have been filed and are staged for remediation per project timeline):
  - **Consent Enforcement:** All tags lack `consentSettings`; Cookiebot CMP is not currently gating behavior
  - **Clarity Tag Deployment:** Microsoft Clarity is not firing on all pages and is not consent-aware
  - **Cross-Domain Tracking:** GA4 tag lacks `linker_domains`, causing session continuity loss across `sfzc.org`, `give.sfzc.org`, and `forms.sfzc.org`


---

## üï∏Ô∏è Related Projects / Cross-Domain Tracking
- **Associated Domains (Needs linker):**
  - `give.sfzc.org`
  - `forms.sfzc.org`
  - `sfzc.org`

- **Linker Status:** GA4 Configuration tag currently **missing `linker_domains`** field.
