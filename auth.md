### Risk Assessment

| Risk                 | Details                                                      |

## 📋 Verified Tracking IDs and Tags
| Platform            | ID / Name                      | Deployment Context              |
|---------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| GA4                 | G-BRXZCXMZP5                    | Web (GTM-TGH83XK)               |

## 🚧 Outstanding Questions / To Be Verified
- Is the server-side GTM container actively in use (e.g., routed via DNS, App Engine, or GA4 forwarding)?
- Can administrative access to `GTM-M7BMM8ZQ` be obtained from Temple Advertising?
- Are any tags still relying on the deprecated UA (`UA-1720237-1`)?

## 🕸️ Related Projects / Cross-Domain Tracking
- **Associated Domains (Needs linker):**
  - `give.sfzc.org`
  - `forms.sfzc.org`
  - `sfzc.org`

- **Linker Status:** GA4 Configuration tag currently **missing `linker_domains`** field.

## 📌 Interaction Prompts and Workflow Signals

These standardized prompts guide the assistant’s behavior across all GTM tasks and sessions:
