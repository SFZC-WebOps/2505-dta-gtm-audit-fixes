## 🚧 Outstanding Questions / To Be Verified
- Is the server-side GTM container actively in use (e.g., routed via DNS, App Engine, or GA4 forwarding)?
- Can administrative access to `GTM-M7BMM8ZQ` be obtained from Temple Advertising?
- Are any tags still relying on the deprecated UA (`UA-1720237-1`)?

## 🕸️ Related Projects / Cross-Domain Tracking
- **Associated Domains (Needs linker):**
  - `give.sfzc.org`
  - `forms.sfzc.org`
  - `sfzc.org`

- **Linker Status:** GA4 Configuration tag currently **missing `linker_domains`** field.

## 📌 Interaction Prompts and Workflow Signals

These standardized prompts guide the assistant’s behavior across all GTM tasks and sessions:

| Prompt Type       | User Prompt Example                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Assistant Behavior                                                                                                                                                   |

| 🚩 **Wrap-up + Save**   | **We're at a good stopping point. Please summarize and commit the key verified information from this session to the proper project files.

> 📅 **Last updated:** 2025-05-18  
> 📎 Added `📌 Interaction Prompts and Workflow Signals` section to formalize assistant behavior for anchoring, feedback requests, and memory-saving actions.  
> ✍️ Clarified that `auth.md` should only store canonical, high-level project truths, while `task-*.md` files store scoped, evolving implementation work.
