### ‚úÖ Verified Local Testing Environment (2025-05-24)
- A controlled GTM validation environment was created using OrbStack + Docker on macOS.
- URL: `http://localhost:8080` served via NGINX container mapped to `/Volumes/webops-work/SITES/gtm-test`
- Used container: `GTM-TGH83XK` (Preview Mode only)
- Consent Mode validated via Tag Assistant (Consent tab):
  - `analytics_storage`: Denied by default
  - `ad_storage`: Denied
  - `security_storage`: Granted
- Confirmed that GTM tags honor consent gating
- No changes were published to production or Drupal



------



## üöß Outstanding Questions / To Be Verified

- Is the server-side GTM container actively in use (e.g., routed via DNS, App Engine, or GA4 forwarding)?
- Can administrative access to `GTM-M7BMM8ZQ` be obtained from Temple Advertising?
- Are any tags still relying on the deprecated UA (`UA-1720237-1`)?
- The following core compliance and tracking capabilities are **not yet implemented** and require remediation before further publishing (these gaps expose SFZC to privacy compliance risk (GDPR/CCPA) and limit analytics accuracy. Tasks have been filed and are staged for remediation per project timeline):
  - **Consent Enforcement:** All tags lack `consentSettings`; Cookiebot CMP is not currently gating behavior
  - **Clarity Tag Deployment:** Microsoft Clarity is not firing on all pages and is not consent-aware
  - **Cross-Domain Tracking:** GA4 tag lacks `linker_domains`, causing session continuity loss across `sfzc.org`, `give.sfzc.org`, and `forms.sfzc.org`


---

## üï∏Ô∏è Related Projects / Cross-Domain Tracking
- **Associated Domains (Needs linker):**
  - `give.sfzc.org`
  - `forms.sfzc.org`
  - `sfzc.org`

- **Linker Status:** GA4 Configuration tag currently **missing `linker_domains`** field.

- **IT Director:** _Dan Belsky_
  - Delegated GTM setup to external vendors in the past (e.g., Temple Advertising)
  - Priorities include GA4 data integrity, fundraising tracking, and privacy compliance.

- **Legacy Contractor:** _Temple Advertising (belen.molinari@templeadv.com)_

## üö´ Production Safeguard Policy

> **MANDATORY DIRECTIVE: No tag changes, publishing actions, or tracking implementations may be performed on production environments unless explicitly validated in a controlled test environment.**

This project operates under a **strict isolation principle**:

- ‚úÖ **All GTM changes must be staged in test environments first**, with all of the following confirmed:
  - `/test-page` route on sfzc.org
  - OrbStack/Docker-based local testbed (`http://localhost:8080`)
  - GTM Preview mode with Consent Debugger, Omnibug, and GA4 DebugView
- üö´ **Do not publish changes directly to production containers until successfully validated in a staging or preview environment, including:**
  - Consent settings (`consentSettings`) are verified
  - Tag firing behavior is validated on controlled pages
  - Tracking parameters appear correctly in GA4 DebugView and all changes have been **successfully tested in GTM Preview Mode**
- ‚úÖ Always:
  - Export and save GTM container versions (`.json`) before changes
  - Use scoped triggers (e.g., `Page URL contains /test-page`) during testing
  - Log all validation results in the associated `task-*.md` file

------

> üîí **This policy ensures GDPR/CCPA compliance, data accuracy, and protects against unintended data leakage or broken analytics.**
>  Any violations must be reported and remediated immediately.
