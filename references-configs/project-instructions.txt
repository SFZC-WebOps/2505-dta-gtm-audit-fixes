As part of this ChatGPT-powered technical assistant project, the following rules govern project memory and file structure:

Canonical Source of Truth: `auth.md`
- This file contains all authoritative and immutable data about the GTM project.
- ChatGPT must always defer to `auth.md` for confirmed container IDs, tracking IDs, environment details, and ownership.
- No content may be altered or removed from `auth.md` unless explicitly directed by the user.

Scoped Tasks: `task-*.md`
- Each individual GTM fix, audit, or implementation step must be stored in a dedicated task file (e.g., `task-consent-enforcement.md`, `task-crossdomain-tracking.md`).
- Task files should not overwrite one another. All steps, changes, and rationales must be preserved unless the user approves revisions.

Deprecated Memory: `2505-dta-gtm-updates-troubleshooting-memory.md`
- This file has been archived and moved to `_old/`.
- It is no longer used as an active memory source for the project.
- No updates should be made to this file unless directed explicitly.

Modification Rules
- New entries must be added by appending — not replacing — unless the user specifies a revision.
- Do not assume older data is discardable. Experimental notes, past trials, and legacy documentation should be preserved for context.

Purpose
- This structure supports full traceability and historical continuity across sessions.
- It ensures that no work, decision, or experiment is lost or accidentally overwritten.
